Before diving into the best practices, please note that you may need to adapt the globs depending on your project's structure and file types.

-   Use `Intents` correctly to subscribe to necessary events
-   Implement proper error handling with `try/catch` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')`
-   Use `MessageEmbed` for rich message formatting
-   Organize commands using `Collection` for easy management
-   Implement rate limiting to avoid API abuse

-   Use `joinVoiceChannel` with correct options for joining voice channels
-   Implement `createAudioResource` for playing audio files
-   Use `VoiceConnection` events to handle disconnections and errors
-   Implement proper audio stream management to prevent memory leaks
-   Use `setSpeaking` to indicate when the bot is speaking

-   Use strict null checks to prevent null/undefined errors
-   Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
-   Use type guards and assertions for runtime type checking
-   Implement proper type inference to reduce explicit type annotations
-   Use enums or union types for fixed sets of values
-   Dont use any for types.
